				<img style="float: right;" src="img/me.jpg" width="200" />
				<p>I am a creative individual who loves computers and all things electronic. I have a special passion for programming that I have been developing since I was three years old (my first computer was a Commodore 64).</p>
				<p>I love to learn how things work which often leads me to finding ways to improve their original functionality. This comes out in my programming as I constantly try to write code that works well, then re-write it as needed to make it work more efficiently.</p>
				<p>I have been programming websites since I was 14, professionally since I was 18. I started in PHP, and have since learned Javacript, Flex, CSS, valid HTML, and many more. I enjoy learning new technologies and looking for ways to challenge my current abilities.</p>
				<p>Along with my high school education, I have over eleven years of PHP experience, two years of Flex experience, three years of Javascript experience, and five years of MySQL experience.</p>
				<p>Check out my recent work for some examples of things I've been working on lately.</p>
				<p>For the past three and a half years I've been working as a freelance employee of Stock20.com and I have been their sole web programmer. Stock20 is looking to downsize some of their operations and wont be requiring a full time web programmer any more. So I am looking to join the team of a great company that requires someone with top of the line PHP, Flex, Javascript, and MySQL programming skills.</p>
