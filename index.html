				<p>I am a creative individual who loves computers and all things electronic. I have a special passion for programming that I have been developing since I was three years old (my first computer was a Commodore 64).</p>
				<p>I love to learn how things work, and I've been taking things apart, fixing them, and making them better since I was a child. This lead me naturally to programming. I also consider myself to be a bit lazy. I consider that a good trait in development because it means I do not like doing things twice. So I am very efficient, and I am very good at automating tasks.</p>
				<p>I have been creating websites since I was 14, professionally since I was 18. I started developing professionally in PHP, and have since branched off into many other areas, including Javascript, Perl, and a great deal of others.</p>
				<p>I have over sixteen years of PHP experience, seven years of Javascript experience, and thousands of hours experience with various other languages and tools. I've helped architect, develop, and maintain enterprise level software grossing hundreds of millions of dollars annually. I'm very comfortable working with a team of other developers using the agile methodology.</p>
				<p>Check out my recent work for some examples of things I've been working on lately.</p>
